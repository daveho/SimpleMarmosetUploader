A simple Eclipse plugin to submit projects to the Marmoset
assignment submission and testing server.

NOTE: as of version 1.0.7, the plugin does NOT support
self-signed SSL certificates.  Your Marmoset installation needs
to be accessed through an SSL certificate to which a chain
of trust can be established from the keystore included with
the JRE that Eclipse is running in.
